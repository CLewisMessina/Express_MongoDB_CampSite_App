# Express/Mongo Based Camp Site App
This multi-page app allows users to create and update campsites along with user associated comments. App features include: 
* User authentication via passport.js (local-strategy) for registration, 
* User log-in and signout, 
* User authorization (restricting campsite and comment edits to their registered authors), 
* CRUD routing and error handling with user notifications via connect-flash. 
* MVC architecture

Note: users must register via the sign-in page to add campsites but seed data is provided.
